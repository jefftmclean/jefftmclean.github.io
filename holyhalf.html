        <h1>Holy Half Marathon</h1>
        <p>After a disastrous 2011 event, this annual 1,300 person charity race at the University of Notre Dame had to prove itself in 2012 to avoid permanent cancellation. A new team led by my friend Carolyn Green took over the event and brought me on as its design director, my first major design engagement as a student. The new branding and website I designed helped our team raise over $30,000 in profit for the 2012 race, which we donated to local charities.</p>

        <p>Our success led us to be rolled into a larger student planning organzation, which had specific requests for changes in the next year's design direction. The website also had to be rebuilt to be usable on phones, as 40% of web traffic came from mobile devices on race day. Our collective efforts raised over $35,000 in charity profit in 2013.</p>
