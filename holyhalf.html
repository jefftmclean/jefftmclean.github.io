          Giving an annual charity race the visibility to become a powerhouse community event.

          After a disastrous 2011 event, this annual 1,300 person charity race at the University of Notre Dame had to prove itself in 2012 to avoid permanent cancellation. A new team took over the event and brought me on to give the race more visibility and legitimacy in the community. I prioritized an identity and a website and made both in the three months before the race.

        <p>
          These materials helped our team raise over $30,000 in profit for the 2012 race, all of which went to local charities. Our success led us to be rolled into a larger student planning organzation, which had specific requests for changes in the next year's design direction. The website also had to be rebuilt to be usable on phones - 40% of web traffic ended up coming from mobile devices on race day. Our collective efforts raised over $35,000 in charity profit in&nbsp;2013.
