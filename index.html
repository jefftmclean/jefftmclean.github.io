      Hello! I'm Jeff, and I do product design at 2U right now. </br> My portfolio isn't here anymore. It was so outdated I literally just needed to take it off the Internet. Obviously I'm not looking for  work right now, but if you want to chat, just email me at <a href="mailto:hello@jeffmclean.io">hello@jeffmclean.io</a>.
