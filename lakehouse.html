          Lakehouse Design
        </h1>
        <p>
          After not getting paid for a freelance design job at school and having no recourse, I realized that there was an unmet need within our student community for structure, mentorship, and collaboration regarding our extracurricular design work. I spent the next two years developing a space within the University of Notre Dame for a student-run design business.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we officially started in 2012, our first task was creating our own visual identity. Our inspiration was the very first design project in the ND design curriculum, where students learn attention to graphic detail by drawing a cube in perfect perspective.
        </p>
        <small>
          Our cube, ironically, ended up being isometric.

        <p>
          The name "Lakehouse" comes from West Lake Hall, the new lakeside building the design department moved into during 2012. We were given a small space in the new building, whose red walls we matched in our branding.
