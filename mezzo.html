          Prototyping a new way to teach fractions to elementary school students through a musical, web-based game.

        <small>Note: this project is still in-progress, currently on hiatus while I catch up on my JS skills and find full-time employment in New York.</small>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">"How can design improve American education?"</span> My BFA design thesis started with that question and ended with a working product prototype. Here's how I got there.

          1. Constrain the scope of the project
        </h3>
        <p>
          Designers can't directly change the complex problems inherent in education&mdash;I would get lost if I tried to imagine a radical change within a context to which I was a newcomer. <span class="bold">Finding a concrete, incremental way to empower a teacher</span> would be much more manageable.
        </p>

            <small>If teachers often have to hammer screws, my role is to provide a screwdriver before critiquing the concept of threaded nails. (I'm looking at you, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/01/23/the-coming-common-core-meltdown/" target="_blank">Common&nbsp;Core<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"> </span></a>)</small>
          </div>

        <p>
          Math had always been my strong suit in school, so I began my research by <span class="bold">conducting interviews with math teachers</span> and <span class="bold">observing their classroom environments</span> to locate the gaps between their existing and ideal toolsets.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2. Stem + Art = STEAM
        </h3>
        <p>
          I found an exciting trend within the STEAM movement, which aims to facilitate <span class="bold">organic discovery of STEM concepts through creative exploration</span> and artistic activities.
        </p>
        <img src="images/projects/mezzo/STEAM.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>
          However, demands of resources, extra planning time, variable learning outcomes, and knowledge in creative disciplines make STEAM lesson plans difficult for a typical math teacher to build. By providing a <span class="bold">packaged creative activity with clear Common Core objectives</span> and <span class="bold">few resource requirements</span>, I could help bring teachers one step closer to a STEAM-integrated curriculum.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. Narrowing down the subject area
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every level of math could have benefited from STEAM, but I wanted to focus on the third grade level for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Potential impact</span>&mdash;third grade math is the critical divergent point where kids who succeed usually continue doing so, and where kids who fail usually never recover.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Practicality</span>&mdash;I had many friends and contacts who happened to be working in elementary school education, so operating at this level would require much less overhead.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>4. Music &amp; Fractions: a perfect* match</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important math concepts at this level is fractions. The best <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20269350/san-bruno-school-uses-music-boost-math-scores" target="_blank">example<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"> </span></a> of STEAM benefits in this subject area used music, an approach which strongly appealed to my own creative <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeff-mclean-2/public-transit" target="_blank">interests<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Despite the opportunity here, though, <span class="bold">unfamiliar music notation and lack of sufficient vocabulary were major obstacles</span> to illustrating specific connections between music and math.
        </p>
        <img src="images/projects/mezzo/chalkboard.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">

          A third-grade music teacher describes to me the abstract concepts and symbols that her third graders struggle to grasp even with daily rehearsal.
        </small>
        <p>
          The challenge from here on out was to create an activity that would allow 9-year-olds to manipulate music <span class="bold">without requiring abstract musical vocabulary or notation</span>.
        </p>

          5. Conserving resources with a web-based product
        </h3>
        <p>
          It was plainly evident from the context and my skillset that a digital solution was the best route. Over the past few years, digital materials have been introducted to classrooms at a breakneck pace. Of all American classrooms...

        <p>
          A web-based solution would not only be accessible to a large majority of classrooms, but it would require zero resources beyond the tools already at their disposal. These digital tools vary dramatically between individual schools, so <span class="bold">keeping my product in the browser</span> was the most universally reliable option.
