        <p>
          Designers can't directly change the complex problems inherent in education&mdash;I would get lost if I tried to imagine a radical change within a context to which I was a newcomer. <span class="bold">Finding a concrete, incremental way to empower a teacher</span> would be much more manageable.

          Math had always been my strong suit in school, so I began my research by <span class="bold">conducting interviews with math teachers</span> and <span class="bold">observing their classroom environments</span> to locate the gaps between their existing and ideal toolsets. I also spoke with education product design professionals on a visit to NYC to learn from their experience and process.

          2. Stem + Art = STEAM
        </h3>
        <p>
          I found an exciting trend within the STEAM movement, which aims to facilitate <span class="bold">organic discovery of STEM concepts through creative exploration</span> and artistic activities.
        </p>
        <img src="images/projects/mezzo/STEAM.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>
          However, demands of resources, extra planning time, variable learning outcomes, and knowledge in creative disciplines make STEAM lesson plans difficult for a typical math teacher to build. By <span class="bold">providing a ready-to-use creative activity with clear Common Core objectives</span> and <span class="bold">few resource requirements</span>, I could help bring teachers one step closer to a STEAM-integrated curriculum.

        <p>
          Every level of math could have benefited from STEAM, but I wanted to focus on the <span class="bold">third grade level</span> for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Potential impact</span>&mdash;third grade math is the critical divergent point where kids who succeed usually continue doing so, and where kids who fail usually never recover.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Practicality</span>&mdash;I had many friends and contacts who happened to be working in elementary school education, so operating at this level would require much less overhead.

          4. Music &amp; Fractions: a perfect* match
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important math concepts at this level is fractions. The best <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20269350/san-bruno-school-uses-music-boost-math-scores" target="_blank">example<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"> </span></a> I could find of STEAM benefits to fractions used music, an approach which strongly appealed to my own creative <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeff-mclean-2/public-transit" target="_blank">interests<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Despite the opportunity here, though, <span class="bold">unfamiliar music notation and lack of sufficient vocabulary were major obstacles</span> to illustrating specific connections between music and math.

          A third-grade music teacher describes to me the abstract concepts and symbols that her third graders struggle to grasp even with daily rehearsal.

          The challenge from here on out was to create an activity that would allow 9-year-olds to manipulate music <span class="bold">without requiring abstract musical vocabulary or notation</span>.

          5. Conserving resources with a web-based product
        </h3>
        <p>
          It was plainly evident from the context and my skillset that a digital solution was the best route. Over the past few years, digital materials have been introducted to classrooms at a breakneck pace. Of all American classrooms...

        <p>
          A web-based solution would not only be accessible to a large majority of classrooms, but it would require zero resources beyond the tools already at their disposal. These digital tools vary dramatically between individual schools, so <span class="bold">keeping my product in the browser</span> was the most universally reliable option.

          I couldn't start building anything without validation, so I put my sketches and an interface prototype in front of teachers for feedback.

        <img src="images/projects/mezzo/paper-prototype.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>
          The response was <span class="bold">overwhelmingly positive from the teachers</span>, who were extremely excited by the idea and wanted to show it to their students. However, the concept was lost on the kids when they only had paper to play with. <span class="bold">I realized that the only way to test with young students would be to have a prototype that made sound by itself</span>, so I built a simple Javascript synthesizer with the Web Audio API and hooked it up to grid of drag-and-drop fraction blocks.

          8. Testing
        </h3>
        <p>
          It was past the time of the school year that this could be used in an actual classroom, so I recruited the children of family friends to run my own mini-music-fraction class. Pretty much all efforts were failing with them until I had them <span class="bold">play a game where they had to visually recreate a simple melody</span> just by listening to it.
        </p>
        <img src="images/projects/mezzo/testing.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>
          They were totally into it, and I got to witness the "eureka" moment where one of the kids quite audibly realized <span class="bold">why a half note lasts longer than an eighth note</span>. Mission accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          I refocused my effort on finding ways to guide kids to that discovery point. Developing a game was the most logical way to go about that.

          I would have liked to experiment with the project much more before pushing it forward, but academic reality forced me to develop a more finished-looking product for my BFA reviews.
